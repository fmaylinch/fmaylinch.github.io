            I recorded the height, width and mass of a selection of oranges, lemons and apples.
            I deliberately bought a few each of some different types to introduce some variety.

             I did not have ready access to calipers or any sophisticated equipment.
             The masses were measured with some digital kitchen scales, which rounded to the nearest 2g.

            The lengths were measured by holding the fruit between two CDs (compact discs) and making marks on a sheet of paper(!).
            This probably introduced some systematic error and a fair amount of random error.

            I just tried to be fairly consistent in my procedure.
            We often have to deal with whatever poor-quality features are available.
            The heights were measured along the core of the fruit.
