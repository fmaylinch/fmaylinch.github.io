Currently, the `index.html` (and folders `assets` and `vite-public`)
are generated from `vite-ts-app` by running `./rebuild.sh` from `vite-ts-app`. 

In case you need an http server to open `index.html`:
```bash
# npm install -g http-server
http-server
```

The previous `index.html` was named to `index-old`.

And the previous `index.html` was renamed to `codethen.html`. That page
has some links to other files in this repo.
