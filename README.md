Currently, the `index.html` is a simple template with a minimal CV
and some fun code to play with it. It uses the files in the `assets` folder.

The previous `index.html` was renamed to `codethen.html`. That page
has some links to other files in this repo.

Now I am adapting the `index.html` to the `vite-ts-app`, there I want to:
- Show how to load the Arkham Horror snippet.
- Adapt the code in `src/assets/js/code.js` to Typescript.
- To do that I need to adapt `CodeMirror` to Typescript (or. bypass the `CodeMirror` object)
